    üëã Hi, this is my first python project, which is an interactive calculator which can help you calculate groceries. This calculator can be considered complicated because you have to copy and paste the code from my github and also have to run it in the code editor, but because this is a fun project so it's just for fun. Enjoy with my first python project
